ucb web mapping homework with leaflet

Here, we are taking earthquake data collected by the USGS, and helping them visualize it through the use of Leaflet. We are to visualize an earthquake dataset (In this repository, we are using the earthquake data collected from the past week, source: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson) and visualizing it on a map. 

The data markers highlight the locations of earthquakes from the data, where its size is determined by the magnitude of the earthquake, and the color determined by the depth, which refers to the legend in the bottom left.
